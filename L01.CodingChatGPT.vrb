\begin{itemize}
	 \item To load the names of the module inside the current namespace the instruction \texttt{from amodule import goofy} must be specified
	 \item It is also possible to import all the names inside \texttt{amodule.py} with the instruction \texttt{from amodule import *}, in which case only the names starting with an \texttt{\_} will not be directly accessible
               \begin{itemize}
		\item in this way it is possible just to call \texttt{goophy()}
              \end{itemize}
	 \item It is also possible to rename an entity or module as
	       \begin{itemize}
		  \item \texttt{import amodule as unmodulo}, leading to calls like \texttt{unmodulo.goophy()} or even
		  \item  \texttt{from amodule import goofy as pippo}, leading to calls like \texttt{amodule.pippo()}
              \end{itemize}
